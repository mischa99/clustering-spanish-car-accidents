# clustering-spanish-car-accidents

The goal of this university project is to analyze the performance of two different clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN)
and find groups in the fatal traffic accidents dataset of Spain,
published by the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) (https://sedeapl.dgt.gob.es/WEB_IEST_CONSULTA/subcategoria.faces).
The dataset has more
than 30 variables among the years 2008 and 2015. We will focus on the data
for the year 2013 (89,519 accidents).

We want to understand the dynamics of the traffic accidents in Spain in that
year. To do this, based on various attributes that characterize the accident, we
intend to â€€find groups of similar accidents and causal relationships that explain
types and severity of accidents. Two different case studies are carried out,
considering different attributes and a specific value subsets for each one of them.

The results and interpretations of the case studies can we found in the pdf file, the code in the notebooks.
